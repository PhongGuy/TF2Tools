# Introduction

TF2Tools will help you change hud, hitsound and kill sound by the click of a button.

## Huds

You upload all your local huds, you can select each hud or just select the parent folder. Now you are ready to install and uninstall huds.

## Hit/kill sound

You upload your collection of sounds(has to be wav files). Now you can install the sounds as a kill or hitsound. Give the sound a name so you can remember them or listen to the sound if you forgot what it sounds like.
